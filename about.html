    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I grew up in Waterloo, I have always liked playing videogames, my childhood was playing games on the family desktop, Tycoon style, strategy games,</p>
    <p>and a random assortment of hand-me-down PS2 games I got when my cousins got a PS3. I later played a bunch of Minecraft and then city builders, Assassins Creeed,</p>
    <p>Civ series, variety of AAA PS4 games, and then loads and loads of Total War Rome 2, and Attila, Crusader Kings, Europa Univeralis, Victoria, Hearts of Iron.</p>
    <p>I went to school for architecture in 2014 but left after a couple semester due to lack of interest</p>
    <p>I went to Humber in fall of 2017 for game programming, and left after a few semesters due to distracions(playing games) and lacking motivation</p>
    <p>I met my wife on tinder using the worldwide setting in summer 2022, visited her in brazil in november 2022, and January 2023 for 10 days, and 3 weeks.</p>
    <p>we wanted to find a place to live together since a visa to canada would have been very unlikely for her</p>
    <p>we decided on germany as we both could get a visa easily, and has high enough english fluency</p>
    <p>I had just got a better paying job, so we decided it might be better for me to stay in Canada, but we got her the visa</p>
    <p>We both flew to Paris, spent a week there, then Rome, spent about a week there, then Berlin for 2 weeks and got her settled in August 2023</p>
    <p>After returning home I started regretting not going as well, so started applying, and moved to Berlin in February 2024</p>
    <p>I proposed in April 2024, we got married in Denmark July 2024, and started the Sponsorship for Canada later in 2024</p>
    <p>While still living in Berlin, I figured I havent done anything really productive while away from home, so I signed up for this online course</p>
    <p>We got approved for the sponsorship at the start of April 2025, and my classes began jsut this week. We fly back to Canada at the end of May</p>
    <p>When back in Canada we can finally really start our lives together</p>

    <h2>Pre Course Coding</h2>
    <p>After I figured I would take a coding course, I decided to start try and relearn some of the stuff from 7-8 years ago and try to make some mini games</p>
    <p>I made a few mini console based games in C#, and a couple simple ones in Unity</p>
